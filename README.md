## Overview
Stock X is a stock market simulator app that allows users to view updates on the stock market in real time. It also allows the user to create a simple profile to virtually buy and sell stocks.


## Using the App
Once a profile is created, the user's information such as user ID and budget are stored in the MySQL database. The user's position information is stored in the database as well every time a purchase is made.


 ## Why is it useful?
Stock X is essential for those who seek to invest in stocks. This app features buying and selling options as well as real time updates on stocks for the user. This way, the user may keep track of their investment activity.


## Getting Started
Users may get started by clicking on the deployed link below, which will lead to the home page. There, a chart of the stock activity as well as stock buying options will appear. In order to buy a stock and save that information, the user must click "new user" at the top right corner of the page. This will prompt the user to create a profile with an ID by filling out the form and clicking "submit". The user's information will then be saved into the app's database. The user may then start buying and or selling.
